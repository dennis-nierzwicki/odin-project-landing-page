## Foundations Project: Landing Page

## Overview
This project is a personal take on a landing page design challenge, created as part of my front-end web development journey. The goal was to build a fully responsive landing page from scratch, using a static design as inspiration. The focus was on translating visual design into functional HTML and CSS while reinforcing layout skills and visual consistency.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox for layout and positioning
- Git & GitHub for version control and project management

## Project Structure
- The landing page includes the following sections:
- Hero Section – A bold introduction at the top of the page
- Content Sections – Informational blocks styled to match the design inspiration
- Footer – Simple and clean, wrapping up the page

I approached the build one section at a time, starting with the HTML content and then applying styles via CSS. This method helped keep the project organized and prevented unnecessary bouncing between files.

## Customization
While the original design provided placeholder text and images, I opted to personalize this project by:
- Replacing dummy content with original or themed text
- Using free, license-safe images from Pexels
- Choosing my color palette and font combinations based on requirements to complete the project
