Foundations Project Landing Page

Foundations Project: Landing Page
🎯 Overview
This project is a personal take on a landing page design challenge, created as part of my front-end web development journey. The goal was to build a fully responsive landing page from scratch, using a static design as inspiration. The focus was on translating visual design into functional HTML and CSS while reinforcing layout skills and visual consistency.

🛠 Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
Flexbox for layout and positioning
Git & GitHub for version control and project management

🧱 Project Structure
The landing page includes the following sections:
Hero Section – A bold introduction at the top of the page
Content Sections – Informational blocks styled to match the design inspiration
Footer – Simple and clean, wrapping up the page

I approached the build one section at a time, starting with the HTML content and then applying styles via CSS. This method helped keep the project organized and prevented unnecessary bouncing between files.

🎨 Customization
While the original design provided placeholder text and images, I opted to personalize this project by:
Replacing dummy content with original or themed text
Using free, license-safe images from Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay
Choosing my own color palette and font combinations to give the page a unique look and feel
